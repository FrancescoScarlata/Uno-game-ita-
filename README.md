# Uno-game-ita

This is the university project done for a subject about programming in Java. It project was made in 4 months, in the period between febrary of 2013 and July 2013.
It's a game based on the notorius game "Uno!".

This was the first project in Java and first project of the bachelor degree (the course was called "Programming I").
This project will show the game Uno!, with not as much feedback as you expected from a usual game.
